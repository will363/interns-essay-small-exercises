##  UML diagrams
## Intro to UML diagrams
    UML is a general purpose modeling language in the field of software engineering.
    The basic level provides a set of graphic notation techniques to create visual model of object
    oriented software- intensive system. Higher level represents cover processing design oriented
    view of a system. 
    It was developed by Grady BOOCH, Ivar JACOBSON and James RUMBAUCH at rational software in 1990s. It was adopted by the Object Management Group (OMG) in 1997, and has been managed by this organization ever since. It is an Object Oriented design methodology.

## Explanation of UML diagrams
    UML is graphic language; it is therefore based on the utilization of diagrams (13 in total). These diagrams are organized in view. A view being a means to describe a system following data angle, at each view corresponds the diagram UML. UML modelises a system according to three axes or view which are: the functional view, the dynamic view and the static view. Today UML is the standard of the widely used object oriented modeling in computer engineering. There are 14 diagram types which can be divided into two main categories.  
    The structural diagrams show the things in a modelled system that is the different objects in a system and the behavioral diagrams show what should happen in a system that is howobjects interact with each other.

### Use case diagram:
    Use Case diagrams are used to analyze the system’s high-level requirements. These requirements 
    are expressed through different use cases. We notice four main components in UML use case diagram:
   * System - a system is whatever you're developing it could be a website, a software component, business process, an app, etc..
   * Actors – they interact with the system; an actor can be a human being, an organization or an
   internal or external application. We have primary actors who innitiates the use of the sysem and secondary actors who are reactionary. 
   * Use case – represents an action that accomplishes some sort of task within the system.
   * Relationships between actors and use cases – represented using straight arrow. There are several types of relationships that are the include, the extend, generalisation and association.

### Sequence Diagram: 
    Sequence diagrams are probably the most important UML diagrams among not only the computer science
    community but also as design-level models for business application development. Lately, they have become popular in depicting business processes, because of their visually self-explanatory nature.
    As the name suggests, sequence diagrams describe the sequence of messages and interactions
    that happen between actors and objects. Actors or objects can be active only when needed or when another object wants to communicate with them. All communication is represented in a chronological manner.

### class diagrams : 
    UML class diagram is the most common diagram type for software documentation. Since most software being created nowadays is still based on the Object-Oriented. Using class diagrams to document the software turns out to be a common-sense solution. This happens because OOP is based on classes and the relations between them.
    In a nutshell, class diagrams contain classes, alongside with their attributes (also referred to 
    as data fields) and their behaviors (also referred to as member functions). More specifically, each class has 3 fields: the class name at the top, the class attributes right below the name, the
    class operations/behaviors at the bottom. The relation between different classes (represented by a connecting line), makes up a class diagram

## Advantages of using UML diagrams
   * Helps in communication.
   * Saves time.
   * Analysis and Design. 
   * System Maintenance.
   * Independence with respect to any programming language.
   * Provides a better understanding of the system. 
   * Implementation of all the richness of the approach object.

## Conclusion
    As can be seen from the above explanations using a UML diagram for documenting processes and systems can be very beneficial. The downside is that it can seem complex at first to draw one. You have got to learn the syntax, you need to choose which diagram out of the 14 different types is the most efficient for the job, etc.. However, once you start thinking in UML standards, you will get a better understanding of the process or system that you are mapping.
