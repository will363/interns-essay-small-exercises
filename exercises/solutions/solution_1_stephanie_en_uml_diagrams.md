##  UML diagrams
### Intro to UML diagrams
    UML is a general purpose modeling language in the field of software engineering.
    The basic level provides a set of graphic notation techniques to create visual model of object
    oriented software- intensive system. Higher level represents cover processing design oriented
    view of a system. 
    It was developed by Grady BOOCH, Ivar JACOBSON and James RUMBAUCH at rational software in 1990s. It was adopted by the Object Management Group (OMG) in 1997, and has been managed by this organization ever since. It is an Object Oriented design methodology.

### Explanation of UML diagrams
    UML is graphic language; it is therefore based on the utilization of diagrams
    (13 in total). These diagrams are organized in view. A view being a means to describe a
    system following data angle, at each view corresponds the diagram UML. UML modelises a
    system according to three axes or view which are: the functional view, the dynamic view
    and the static view. 
    Today UML is the standard of the widely used object oriented modeling in computer
    engineering. There are 14 diagram types which can be divided into two main categories:
    structural diagram and behavioral diagram.
    
    The Structural diagram has the following
   * class diagram : It is a diagram which shows the static structure of a system. it Represents system class, attributes and relationships among the classes
   * object diagram : it allows the representation of various objects used in the system. it represents a complete or partial view of the structured modeled system.
   * Component Diagram: it represents how components are split in a software system and dependencies amongst them.
   * Deployment Diagram: it describes the hardware used in system implementations.
   * Package Diagram: it represents splitting of a system into logical groupings and dependency amongst groupings.
   * Composite Structure Diagram: it describes the internal structure of classes. 

    And the Behavioral diagram has the following
    * Use case diagram: it describes the form of actions and reactions, the beahvior of a system and from the point of view of a user
    * Activity Diagram: It describes under the form of flows or succession of activities the behavior of the system or its components.
    * state machine Diagram: it utilizes events and states.
    * Sequence Diagram: it shows interaction between objects according to a temporal point of view
    * Communication Diagram: it is an extension of the obeject diagram. it represent interaction between objects in terms of sequence of messages.
    * Interaction Overview Diagram: it provides an overview and nodes representing communication diagrams.

### Advantages of using UML diagrams
   * Visual Representation.
   * Standardization.
   * Analysis and Design. 
   * System Maintenance.
   * Independence with respect to any programming language, 
   * Powerful support of communication, 
   * Implementation of all the richness of the approach object, 
   * Description of all the models of the analysis to the realization of the software

### Conclusion
    As can be seen from the above explanations using a UML diagram for documenting processes and systems can be very beneficial. The downside is that it can seem complex at first to draw one. You have got to learn the syntax, you need to choose which diagram out of the 14 different types is the most efficient for the job, etc.. However, once you start thinking in UML standards, you will get a better understanding of the process or system that you are mapping.
