# Title: Essay on UML diagrams.

## Introduction
    UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. It is a general purpose visual modeling language that is intended to provide a way to visualize and specialize the design of a system. It is a set of rules specifically for drawing diagrams.


### Some notations on a UML diagram    
* Frames and content areas
Content areas are the spaces the diagram occupies and to organise it, it is advisable to be put in frames.
* Packages: they are used to group elements under a common name.
* Classifiers: decribe a set of objectives that have a state and relationship to other objects. It is represented in rectangles.
* Objects: It differenciates the classes by its underlined name.
* Arrows:shows the relationship between elements in the diagram.
 

 ## Some types of UML diagrams.
* USE CASE DIAGRAMS: These are high-level overview of the relationship between the actors and the system. This is a simple way of explaining a system to a non-technical audience.
A use case diagram consists of an actor(s). There are 2 types of actors -primary and -secondary actors.
An actor represents a role of a user that interacts with the system that you are modeling

* Components of a use case diagram
- Actors
- System
- Relationships
- Use cases

* SEQUENCE DIAGRAM: It is referred to as an event scenario.It shows the order in which the object interacts.

* Components of sequence diagram.
- Messages
- Lifelines
- Loops
- Class roles


* CLASS DIAGRAMS: Shows the static structure of a system, including classes, their attributes and behaviour and relationship between each class. A class is represented in a rectangle.

* Components of a class diagram: It has 3 vital components which are;
- Upper section: Consists of the class name. A class is a representation of similar objects that share the same relationship, attributes,operations.
- Middle section: The middle section consists of the attributes, which describes the quality of the class.
- Lower section contains methods or operations. The method is represented in the form of a list where each method is written on its own line.


## Advantages of UML diagrams.
* Readability and re-usability
    The diagram is meant to be understood by any type of programmer and it helps to explain the relationships in a program in a straightforward manner.

* Standard
    UML visually describes the relationship between classes and other objects because it is used as a standard and it's widely understood, making it easy for a new programmer to step into a project and be productive.

* Planning tool
    UML helps to plan a program before the programming takes place. In some tools used to model UML, the tool  willl generate a code passed on the classes set up in the model. This can help reduce overhead during the implementation  stage of any program. Also, UML modeling diagrams are easy to change, whereas reprogramming a section of code can be tedious and time-consuming.


## Conclusion 
    The creating of a UML diagrams is the best tool to use when communicating the meaning and content behind a codebase. UML diagrams help developers to see the picture of the system. This can help them to better understand the system and identify potential challenges. It also allows the developer to see how different system parts interact with each other.
