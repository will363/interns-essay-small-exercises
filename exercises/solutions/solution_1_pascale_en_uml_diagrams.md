# **UML Diagrams**

A UML diagram is a diagram based on the UML(Unified Modeling Language) used to analyze existing software, model new software, and plan software development and prioritization.

## **Introduction** 

Most commonly a UML diagram is a diagram with the purpose of visually representing a system along with its main actors, roles, actions, artifacts or classes, in order to better understand, alter, maintain, or document information about the system. UML was created as a clear modeling language for developers to use. It was designed to be simple and easy to understand so that everyone could follow the process and design of the software.

For software developers, keeping on top of hierarchies and relationships within a system can be difficult — especially when focusing on complex and detailed areas of code.

But using a UML model divides these systems into components and subcomponents. This makes it easier to visualize, plan, and execute their project.

## **Explanation of  UML Diagrams**

There are various types of UML diagrams that are used for different software structures. There are 14 official types, with some additional versions that aren’t officially recognized but are widely used.

The diagrams are split into two different categories: structural diagrams and behavioral diagrams.

A structure diagram shows how a system is constructed. This includes components, classes, objects, package, profile, deployment, composite structure and how all of these elements connect.

Behavior diagrams visualize how a system interacts with itself, users, and other systems. This includes State machine, use case, sequence, activity, timing, communication and interctions.

 ### **Use case diagram**

Use case diagrams show interactions between users also known as ‘actors’ and represented as stick figures and the system itself.
It illustrates system functionality, focusing on the expected behavior of the system and showing what will happen and when.
A use case diagram is often used as a top-level overview of how users and systems interact. As a result, it’s a useful way for a non-technical audience which can include key stakeholders to visualize your system.

 ### **Sequence diagram**

 Sequence diagrams sometimes known as event diagrams show the order in which your objects interact. This includes the lifelines of your objects, the processes that interact with your objects, and the messages exchanged between the objects to perform a function.

These diagrams are often used by developers and business professionals to understand how to structure a new system or improve an existing process.

 ### **Class diagram**

 A class diagram allows you to map the structures of a system displaying various classes, attributes, operations, and relationships between objects. Both software engineers and business managers use this interaction diagram to model different connections involved within a process.

In the diagram, class is represented with a rectangle. Each rectangle is split vertically into three sections. The top section has the name of the class. The second and third sections provide details about class operations, behaviors, and attributes.

Because software is typically based on object-specific programming, a class diagram is probably the most commonly used UML diagram.


## **Advantages of using UML Diagrams**

Some benefits of using UML diagrams;

- ### **Keep everyone on the same page**

UML is a standardized language. Every UML element means the same thing no matter what business is using them and what the diagram is for.

- ### **Explore different options**

Rolling out new software or updating an existing one can be a costly and time-consuming process. For this reason, it’s not always possible to test different versions of the software to see what works best.This is where a UML diagram can help;
Before you launch the new software, you can use the diagram to test out different structures. As a result, you can make changes and improvements before launching the software. This saves you both time and money in the long run.
 
- ### **Have clear documentation of workflow**

By using a UML diagram, you’re able to document your new software or business processes. This means you can track progress over time, make sure things are going to plan, and identify key areas of improvement.

## **Conclusion**

As conclusion UML diagrams a diagram is a simplified and made up visual representation of concepts, ideas, constructions, relationships, statistical data, anatomy, etc. employed in all aspects of human endeavor to visualize and elucidate matter. UML is intended to facilitate the design of the documents necessary for the development of object-oriented software, as a standard for modeling software architecture.
