# Introduction on UML
UML is meant to be a unifying language enabling IT professionals to Model computer applications. UML stands for Unified Modelling Language. It is a generic developmental modelling language used for analysis, design and implementation of software systems. The purpose of UML is to provide a simple and common method to visualise a sotftware system's inherent architectural properties. It is an excellent meams of visualizing a system's blueprint. It is used in software based systems, bussiness modelling and associated operations for analysis, design, and execution

Some UML diagrams are;
# Use case Diagram
A use case diagram illustrates a unit of fuctionality provided by the system. Its main purpose is to help development teams visualize the functional requirements of a system, including the relationship among different use cases. The 4 main components of a use case diagram are actors,systems,reationships and use cases.The use case is a description of a system's behaviour for a user's standpoint. The actor is the entity that initiates the use case. It can be a person or another system. The use case is an excellent tool for stimulating potential users to talk about system from their viwpoints.

# Class Diagrams
The class diagram shows the different entitites (People,things and data) related to each other, that is, it shows the static structures of the system. A class diagram can be used to display logical classes.
The rectangle isthe icon for the class. Properties of a class diagram are; class name,attriute,operations. Attributes is a property of a class. a class may have no or more attributes. In a class diagram or icon, you can specify a type for each attribute's value like: String, integer,number,boolean or even a default value.
An operation is something that a class can do or that another clas can do to a class

# Sequence Diagram
It illustrates the sequence messages between objects in an interaction. that is, It describes how and in which order a group of object work together. I other words, it describes interactions among classes iterms of an exchange of messages over time. Some basic key parts of a UML sequence diagram are;Lifetimes, Messages, Execution  occurence, self message, lost message, Found message
Lifetimes: It represents an individual participant in a sequence diagram.
Self message: It can represent a recursive call of an operation, or one method calling another method belonging to the same object 
Lost messsages: These are messages that are either sent but do not arrive at the intended recipient or which goes to a recipient not shown on the current diagram. 
Found message: These are messages thatarrive from an unknown sender not shown on the current diagram. They are denoted going to or coming from an endpoint element

# Benefits of UML
-Your software system is professionally designed and documented before it is coded. You will know exactly what you are getting, in advance. 
-Since system design comes first, reusable code is easily spotted and coded with the highest efficiency. You will have lower development costs. 
-UML lets us see the big picture. We can develop more memory and processor efficient systems. 
-When we come back to make modifications to your system, it is much easier to work 
on a system that has UML documentation. Much less relearning takes place. Your system maintenance costs will be lower. 
-8 If we need to communicate with outside contractors or even your own programmers, it is much more efficient. 
-Using the Unified Modeling Language will result in lower overall costs, more reliable and efficient software, and a better relationship with all parties involved. Software documented with UML can be modified much more efficiently.

# Conclusion 
As conclusion UML can be defined as a modeling language to capture the architectural, behavioural and structural aspects of a system
