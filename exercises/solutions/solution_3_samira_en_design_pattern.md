# Introduction and definition on design patterns 
     Design Patterns are models of code that solve classic problems. THey are solutiond to software design problems that you can find in a real-world application. A Design pattern  is not a code that is readyvto be used in your application, but it is a model that you can use to solve a problem.
     Design patterns are language neutral, so they can be applied to any language that supports object-orientation. Also pattern designing refers to the process of creating a blue print or template for a garment a textile itm, Pattern designing involves a combination of artistic creativity and techical skill and it plays an essential role in the fshion industry and other related fields, In other to create a pattern, a designer typically begins wilth a sketch or series of sketches which serve as a visual representation of the design concept. 

# Why and when should we use Desig Patterns?
Design patterns exists to help developers. They enable us to implement tried and tested solutions (that is also used by other developers) to know problems, this way saving time and effort during the implementation of the code. They also define common words to talk about specific problems, making it easier to communicate.
Sometimes you do not need a design pattern, and this is good to keep in mind, we should just use it when necessary. Each design patter can be used for a specific situation, and that's one of the reason why it's important to know about them, because you can have a problem that is a known problem  in the software development world and already exists a good solution to solve it by using a design pattern. This way you do not need to reinvent the wheel, you can just use something that already exists and works well. So the bst way to use it or m=not, it's to learn them and understand which problem each design pattern can solve.

# The elements of a design pattern
- A name: That is used to describe a design problem, the solution and the consequences.
- The problem: It describes when we need to apply the pattern, explaining the problem and its context
- The solution: It describes the elements that make up the design, the relationships, the responsibilities and collaborations. The solutions do not desvribe a concrete implementation, because a pattern is like a template which can be applied in many different situations, but provides an abstract description of the design problem and how a general arrangement of elements solves it.
- Consequences: These are the results of applying the patterns

# Types of design patterns
1. Creational
These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. These patterns can be further categorized into class-creational patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the work done

2. Structural
These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. Structural design patterns are Adapter, bridge, composite, decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Private class data and proxy

3. Behavioral 
Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns. Behavioral patterns and chain of reponsibility, command, interpreter, iterator, mediator, memento, null object, onserver, state, strategy, template method, visitor.

# Advantages of design pattern
- Precision: The primary advantage of pattern designing is that it allows for precise and accurate measurements and calculations, resulting in a well fitted garment.
- Efficiency: Creating a pattern saves time and effort in the production process. Once the pattern is created, it can be used to make multiple garments, reducing the time and resources needed to create each one.
- Creativity: Patterns designing allows for creative expression and experimentation, enabling designers to explore different styles, shapes, and techniques
- Consistency: Apattern ensures consistency in the production process, resulting in a uniformity of the finished product, which is essential for large-scale manufacturing.
- Replicability: Patterns can be replicated and used for different sizes, styles, and fabrics, making them a valuable asset for designers and manufacturers.

# Disadvantages of design pattern
1. Cost: Pattern designing can be expensive, particularly if it involves specialised software or equipment.
2. Skills: Pattern designing requires specialised knowledge and skills, which may not be available to everyone
3. Time-consuming: Creating a patterncan be a time consuming process, requiring attention to detail and numerous adjustments to ensure a proper fit
4. Limited creativity: Working within the confines of a pattern can limit the designer's creativity, making it difficult to create unique or innovative designs
5. Sustainability: The production of patterns, particularly on paper, can contribute to waste and harm to the environment.

# Conclusion
A design pattern provides a general resuable solution for the common problems that occur in software desgin.
The pattern typically shows relationships and interactions between classes or objects. The idea is to speed up the development process by providing well-tested, proven developmet/design paradigms
