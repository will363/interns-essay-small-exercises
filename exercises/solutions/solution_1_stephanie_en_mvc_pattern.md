## MVC
### Introduction
    MVC which stands for Model View Controller and is a software architectural design pattern.It is one of the most popular design patterns. MVC promotes an organised programming environment. It is commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.

### Explanation of the MVC design pattern
    The Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern is vividly explained below
   * Model: the model interacts with the database. This part of the design pattern is primary and contains application information. It operates independently of the user interface and controls the logic and rules of the application.The model communicates with the controller
   * View: the view is the user interface. This part helps the user to see the model’s data. The main concern of the view is to access the model’s data. The view section uses a chart, table, or diagram to represent the information. It is a visualization of information that the application contains.
   * Controller: Most of the work is done by the controller. It provides support for input and converts the input to commands for the application. It is used between the model and the views part. The model and the view are interconnected, so the execution is reflected in the view part.

### Advantages of using the MVC design pattern
   * It has the architecture to provide multiple Views.
   * It helps in developing an application that loads at a significantly faster rate.
   * Modification of the user interface does not affect the Business Logic.
   * It helps in developing larger applications with a definite structure.

### Disadvantages of using the MVC design pattern
   * It is hard to understand the MVC architecture.
   * Must have strict rules on methods.

## Conclusion
    The most attractive concept of the MVC pattern is separation of concerns.
    Modern web applications are very complex, and making a change can sometimes be a big headache.Managing the frontend and backend in smaller, separate components allows for the application to be scalable, maintainable, and easy to expand.
